      If there is one thing I know, it is that mulch is what makes the world go 'round. 
      In the beginning, there was mulch, in the middle, there was also quite a bit of mulch, and in the end, 
      of course, there will only be mulch that remains. We all came from mulch, and we will all return to mulch. 
      Indeed, one might say that this world is simply "Mulch ado about nothing." I know for certain that there can only be mulch in a good man's heart, for where else would the trees and flowers bloom from? I have mulch to give you, but not mulch else, I'm afraid. I hope this all wasn't too mulch for you, but be quick, my friend, and make haste, for there is not mulch time left.
